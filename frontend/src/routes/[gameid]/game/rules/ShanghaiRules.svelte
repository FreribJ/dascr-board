            Each player takes a turn throwing three darts to score the highest
            score possible in that round.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are 20 throw rounds with the target 1 through 20. Only the
            hits on the number of the round are counted towards the score.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, only 1's count in the first round, 2's in the second,
            etc. "Doubles" counts as twice the number scored and the "Triples"
            counts as three times.
        </p>

        <p>
            After all twenty rounds have been completed whoever has the highest
            score wins.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second way to win is to "Shanghai" your opponent. To Shanghai,
            you must hit one dart in the single, one in the triple and one in
            the double of the target number in any order. If you succeed in
            hitting a Shanghai, the game is over and you win regardless of the
            other player(s) score.
